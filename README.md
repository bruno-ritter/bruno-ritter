Hi, I'm @bruno-ritter
- 👀 I am interested in data science, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
- 🌱 I am currently learning all the necessary skills to be able to participate in data-based projects and in the development of daaps. I'm still at the beginning level of Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on data and blockchain projects. I can collaborate by cleaning up data and other entry-level activities.
- 📫 How to contact me: You can contact me at bruno.maritter@gmail.com. I live in Brazil so this is the easiest way to get in touch with me.
